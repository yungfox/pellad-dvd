Bouncing DVD logo style animation with my band's logo.<br>
Optimized for PAL CRT televisions (640x480 resolution, 50 fps), since that's where it usually gets displayed on during live shows.

## Quick start

Just open `index.html` in any browser that supports [HTMLCanvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API#browser_compatibility). Or serve it with [Live Server](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server) in Visual Studio Code (or any other server for that matter) if you're feeling fancy.
